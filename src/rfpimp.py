    """
    Compute permutation feature importances for scikit-learn models using
    a validation set.

    Given a Classifier or Regressor in model
    and validation X and y data, return a data frame with columns
    Feature and Importance sorted in reverse order by importance.
    The validation data is needed to compute model performance
    measures (accuracy or R^2). The model is not retrained.

    The model.score() method is called to measure accuracy drops.

    This version that computes accuracy drops with the validation set
    is much faster than the OOB, cross validation, or drop column
    versions. The OOB version is a less vectorized because it needs to dig
    into the trees to get out of examples. The cross validation and drop column
    versions need to do retraining and are necessarily much slower.

    This function used OOB not validation sets in 1.0.5; switched to faster
    test set version for 1.0.6. (breaking API change)

    :param model: The scikit model fit to training data
    :param X_valid: Data frame with feature vectors of the validation set
    :param y_valid: Series with target variable of validation set
    :param n_samples: How many records of the validation set to use
                      to compute permutation importance. The default is
                      3500, which we arrived at by experiment over a few data sets.
                      As we cannot be sure how all data sets will react,
                      you can pass in whatever sample size you want. Pass in -1
                      to mean entire validation set. Our experiments show that
                      not too many records are needed to get an accurate picture of
                      feature importance.
